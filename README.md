# GAB-Challenge-1


In this project I refactored the code of a webpage to make it easier to read and follow.
I added semantic html elements and consolidated the css selectors and properties to follow the semantic structure of the html.
I added comments to help easily identify the different sections of the page.
I broke and then fixed the links in the nav bar so they would navigate to the correct section of the webpage.
I added alt attributes to the image elements so they could be easily identified.
I added a concise title to the page
